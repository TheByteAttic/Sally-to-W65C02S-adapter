This is a small daughter board that fits into the socket of the "Sally" custom CPU in the Atari 800XL, 65XE and 130XE microcomputers (the RF shield must be removed, otherwise the daugher board won't fit inside). It replaces that CPU with a CMOS, modern, low-power, fully static, currently in production W65C02S CPU and some auxiliary logic. The project has been featured in three videos in my YouTube channel ("The Byte Attic," https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfzZNuoHys1t-AdwYDhOz8g).
