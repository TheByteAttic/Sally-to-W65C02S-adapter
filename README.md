This is a small daughter board that fits into the socket of the "Sally" custom CPU in the Atari 800XL computer. It replaces that CPU with a CMOS, modern, low-power, currently-manufactured W65C02S and some auxiliary logic. The project has been featured in three videos in my YouTube channel ("The Byte Attic," https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfzZNuoHys1t-AdwYDhOz8g).
